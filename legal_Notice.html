                    <h2>Liability for content</h2> <br>

                    <p>The content of this site has been created with the greatest of care. I cannot, however, guarantee
                        that the information in it is accurate, complete or up-to-date. As a service provider I am
                        responsible under Section 6(1) of the German Media Services Inter-State Agreement and Section
                        8(1) of the German Teleservices Act for my own content on this site. Service providers are not
                        however obliged to monitor third party information transmitted or stored on their site by them
                        or to look for circumstances which may suggest a violation of the law. This does not affect my
                        statutory obligations to remove or block the use of information. My liability in such cases
                        shall however commence from the time I become aware of an actual violation. On becoming aware of
                        such violations I shall remove this content immediately.</p> <br>
                    <h2> Liability for links</h2> <br>
                    <p>This website contains links to external third-party websites, over the content of which I have no
                        control. I cannot, therefore, make any guarantees regarding this third-party content.
                        Responsibility for the content of linked sites lies solely with the provider or operator of the
                        site concerned. All linked sites were checked for possible violations of the law when they were
                        linked to mine. At that time I was not aware of any content which may violate the law. However,
                        I cannot be expected to monitor the content of linked sites on an ongoing basis unless I have
                        reason to suspect a violation of the law. On becoming aware of such a violation I shall remove
                        the respective link immediately.</p>
                    <h2>Copyright</h2> <br>
                    <p>The operator of this site makes every effort to respect the copyrights of outside parties and to
                        employ his own material and material in the public domain. All content and material on this site
                        created by the site operator is governed by German copyright law. Downloads and copies of this
                        site may be made for private, non-commercial use only. Reproduction, processing, distribution
                        and any form of exploitation beyond that permitted by copyright law requires the written consent
                        of the author or creator concerned. Contributions by third parties are identified as such.
                        Should anyone become aware of a possible copyright infringement, I kindly request that you
                        inform me of such. Upon becoming aware of such a violation I shall remove the respective content
                        immediately.</p> <br>
                    <h2>Data protection</h2> <br>
                    <p>As a rule the use of this website is possible without providing any personally relevant data. Any
                        provision of personal data (e.g. name, address or email addresses) occurs entirely on a
                        voluntary basis. These data will not be provided to any third parties without the user's express
                        approval. Be aware that the transmission of data via the internet (e.g. communication by email)
                        is subject to security gaps. Complete protection of data from unauthorized access by third
                        parties is not possible. The use of contact details published under the statutory requirement to
                        provide acknowledgements by third parties for the purpose of the transmission of unsolicited
                        advertising and informational material is expressly opposed. The site operator expressly
                        reserves the right to take legal action against the unsolicited mailing of advertising
                        information by way of spamming or similar.</p>
